## Key Areas for Improvement  

Hari Das's financial health highlights critical weaknesses that require immediate attention. While liquidity is moderate (57.02%), it falls short of the desired threshold for optimal safety. Over 42.98% of assets are allocated to low-yield instruments like provident funds, with no exposure to real estate, indicating a need for diversification and better-yielding growth instruments like equity or mutual funds. The retirement corpus gap of ₹22.84 Crore is significant and presents the most immediate concern, necessitating disciplined, high-growth savings strategies. Education funding, a high-priority goal, is far from being fully addressed and requires urgent savings adjustments to align with future projected costs of ₹1.19 Crore. Additionally, discretionary spending on vacations and luxury goals should be curtailed to focus on debt clearance and achieving critical milestones, as the outstanding loans total ₹6.80 Lakh.

## Way Forward  

- Focus on building a high-growth investment plan to address the ₹22.84 Crore retirement gap.  
- Prioritise education funding by increasing savings to meet the ₹1.19 Crore projected future cost.  
- Reassess asset allocation to reduce overexposure to low-yield instruments and invest in higher yield options like equities or diversified mutual funds.  
- Avoid luxury and discretionary goals such as expensive vacations and gadgets; allocate funds towards debt clearance and critical priorities.  
- Improve liquidity ratio by enhancing liquid asset reserves to ≥70% of total assets.  
- Adopt strict spending controls to redirect savings toward both debt repayment and priority goals.
